- Background: Radial gradients with soft pastels

### Typography
- Headlines: Extrabold, large sizes (3xl-5xl)
- Body: Regular weight, readable sizes
- Colors: `#2E3A28` (dark green) for text, `#6A7A6A` for secondary

### Components
- Rounded corners (xl, 2xl, 3xl)
- Backdrop blur effects on cards
- Soft shadows
- Gradient buttons and progress bars
- Smooth Framer Motion animations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management

- Optimized re-renders
- Lazy calculations on demand

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Clear button labels and icons
