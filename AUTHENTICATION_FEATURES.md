## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### New User Journey
1. User visits site → sees "Sign In" button
2. Clicks "Sign In" → Auth modal opens
3. Switches to "Sign up" tab
4. Enters name, email, password
5. Clicks "Create Account" or "Continue with Google"
6. **Auto-creates user profile in Firestore**
7. Modal closes, user is signed in
8. Progress is saved to cloud automatically

### Returning User Journey
1. User visits site → Auth state is checked
2. If previously signed in → **auto-signs in** (Firebase persists session)
3. **Loads all data from Firestore**:
   - User progress (XP, streak)
   - Episode progression
   - Flashcards
4. User continues learning
5. All progress **auto-syncs** to cloud

### Existing Local User Journey
1. User who used site before (with localStorage data) signs in
2. **System detects localStorage data**
3. **Automatically migrates** all progress to Firestore
4. User doesn't lose any progress!
5. Can now access from any device

## 🔒 Security Features

### Authentication Security
- ✅ **Password minimum 6 characters** (Firebase requirement)
- ✅ **Email validation**
- ✅ **Secure password storage** (Firebase handles hashing)
- ✅ **Session management** (Firebase handles tokens)
- ✅ **Brute force protection** (Firebase built-in)

### Data Security
- ✅ **User can only access their own data** (Firestore rules)
- ✅ **Environment variables** for sensitive config
- ✅ **No API keys in code** (uses .env.local)
- ✅ **Server-side timestamps** (prevents date manipulation)

### Firestore Security Rules (To be set up)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      match /flashcards/{flashcardId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    match /progressions/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works Technically

### Firebase Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Firebase validates and creates/verifies user
3. Firebase returns auth token
4. Token stored in browser (HttpOnly cookie - secure)
5. `onAuthStateChanged` listener fires
6. App loads user data from Firestore
7. UI updates with authenticated state

### Auto-Sync Flow
```
User completes action (e.g., finishes chapter)
    ↓
Update local React state (instant UI update)
    ↓
Check if user is authenticated
    ↓
If yes: Send update to Firestore (background sync)
    ↓
If error: Log but don't block user (graceful degradation)
    ↓
Next time user signs in: Full sync from Firestore
```

### Migration Flow (localStorage → Firestore)
```
User signs in for first time
    ↓
Check for localStorage data
    ↓
If found: Read progression + flashcards
    ↓
Upload to Firestore under user's ID
    ↓
Confirm sync successful
    ↓
Clear localStorage (optional, for cleanup)
    ↓
User now synced across devices!
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### 1. Create `.env.local` file
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
```

### 2. Enable Firebase Features

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No email verification** - Users can sign up without confirming email (can be added)
2. **Test mode Firestore rules** - Need production rules for deployment
3. **No rate limiting** - Firebase provides basic protection but can add more
4. **No user profile editing UI** - Backend ready, frontend needs a settings page
